## About

The Train Booking website was created to enable students using the train to go to school to purchase their train tickets conveniently. The train's destination is Moringa School, and it passes through three pick-up destinations. The train's departure from the first station is usually at 6:00 am in the morning. It arrives at the second pick-up destination between 7:00 and 7:30 and the third pick-up destination between 8:00 and 8:30. The train reaches the final destination, the school, at exactly 9:00 am.

The website offers affordable prices for train tickets as it operates as a charity to the community. For any inquiries or assistance, you can reach out to us using the contact information provided below.
